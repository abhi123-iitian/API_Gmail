Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script requires specific Python libraries to interact with Google APIs.
Installation

    Install Required Python Packages

    To install the necessary Python packages, run the following command:
    pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
This will install google-api-python-client, google-auth-httplib2, and google-auth-oauthlib
Setting Up Credentials

    You need to have a credentials.json file to authenticate with Google APIs.
    If you don't have this file, obtain it from the Google Developer Console.
    Place the credentials.json file in the root directory of your project or specify its path in your script.
    Running the Script

    Run your Python script as usual. Make sure it has access to the credentials.json file.
    Follow any on-screen prompts to authenticate.
